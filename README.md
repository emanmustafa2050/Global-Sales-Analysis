# Global-Sales-Analysis
# Project Overview : 
   This project analyzes global sales data to uncover key business insights. 
   The dataset includes sales transactions from multiple regions, allowing us to explore sales trends, product performance, and customer demand.

# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
    Data cleaning was performed using Python to ensure accuracy and consistency. The steps included:
    Handling missing values (e.g., filling missing STATE and TERRITORY with "Unknown").
    Removing duplicate records and Unnecessary fields (address line2 , Postal code).
    Standardizing date formats and categorical data.
    Ensuring data integrity before importing into Tableau.
